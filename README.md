# Linear Transformation 

This example was inspired by a question on one of my talks this year about AI tools and Basics of AI! 

"How math is used in the machine learning?! I often seen people mentioning it is used in the ML, but where it is used and how transformations are applied. I am missing how it actually used" 

So i created this example to illustrate how image represented in the matrix format can be used in the ML/DL. It is more of the data preprocessing step rather than actual machine learning but it can give idea how matrices are used in ML :)
